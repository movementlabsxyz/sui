Variables offer a way to introduce dynamic inputs to a re-usable/static query. A variable is declared in the parameters to a `query` or `mutation`, using the `$` symbol and its type (in this example `Int`) which must be a `scalar`, `enum`, or `input` type. In the query body, it is referred to by its name (again prefixed with the `$` symbol).

If a variable is declared but not used in the query or not defined (supplied a value), the query will fail to execute.

To learn more, read the GraphQL documentation on [Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).

In the following example, the ID of the epoch being queried is supplied by a variable.

```graphql
query ($epochID: Int) {
  epoch(id: $epochID) {
    referenceGasPrice
  }
}
```

**Variables**:
```json
{
   "epochID": 100
}
```

## In the IDE

When using the online IDE, variables are supplied as a JSON object to the query in the "Variables" pane at the bottom of the main editing window. If a variable is supplied but not declared, a warning will be issued.

## In Requests

When making a request to the GraphQL service (for example, using `curl`), the query and variables are passed as two fields of a single JSON object:

```bash
 curl -X POST https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
     "query": "query ($epochID: Int) { epoch(id: $epochID) { referenceGasPrice } }",
     "variables": { "epochID": 100 }
   }'
```
